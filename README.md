Urban residents currently lack a centralized and transparent way to report local issues such as potholes, litter, or noise, and to track their resolution. The proposed solution is to build a web and mobile platform that allows citizens to log these urban issues, view their status and progress, and receive timely updates. On the other side, city officials can use an admin panel to assign tasks, escalate matters, and resolve cases. By relying solely on software workflows rather than physical sensors, the system aims to foster civic participation and ensure accountability in addressing community concerns.
For Citizens:The platform offers an easy reporting system where users can submit complaints or issues by selecting a relevant category—such as sanitation, roads, or attaching supporting photos, and pinpointing the exact location via maps or GPS.Through real-time progress tracking, each report is assigned a unique ticket ID, enabling citizens to follow its journey from “logged” to “assigned,” “in progress,” and finally “resolved.”To encourage community engagement, residents can explore a map or list of unresolved problems, upvote issues that affect them, leave comments, and view which reports have gathered the most public support.Once an issue is resolved, a feedback loop allows users to rate their satisfaction, helping authorities identify areas for further service improvement.
For Authorities/Municipal Staff:The system features automated ticket routing that directs each new report to the relevant department or team based on category and location, minimizing manual sorting.A centralized dashboard provides staff with a comprehensive view of all active cases, filtered by type, locality, urgency, and update history. From here, they can assign tasks to field teams, set priorities, and update statuses.
